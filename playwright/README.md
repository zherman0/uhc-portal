# Playwright E2E Tests

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and Yarn installed on your system (see package.json for the compatible versions).

### Install Dependencies

From the project root directory, install all dependencies including Playwright:

```bash
# Install all project dependencies (including Playwright)
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npm exec -- playwright install

# Optional: Install only Chromium browser for faster setup
npm exec -- playwright install chromium
```

### Verify Installation

You can verify that Playwright is properly installed by running:

```bash
# Check Playwright version
npm exec -- playwright --version

# List available tests (without running them)
npm run playwright-headless -- --list
```

## Setup

### Environment Variables

The tests support multiple authentication methods and cloud provider configurations. All environment variables should be configured in the `playwright.env.json` file.

#### Authentication Methods

The tests support:

- **Username/Password Authentication**: Standard Red Hat SSO login

1. **Username/Password Authentication (Primary)**:
   - `TEST_WITHQUOTA_USER` - Username for test authentication
   - `TEST_WITHQUOTA_PASSWORD` - Password for test authentication

#### Configuration Files

The test configuration uses `playwright.env.json` for environment-specific settings. All authentication credentials, cloud provider settings, infrastructure configurations, and test environment options are mapped in this file.

**Note**: Create your own `playwright.env.json` file based on this structure. This file is not part of the repository and should not be committed to version control as it contains sensitive credentials.

### Running Tests

#### Using custom playwright script commands (Recommended)

```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode (CI/CD mode)
npm run playwright-headless

# Run tests with UI mode (interactive test explorer)
npm run playwright-ui

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser actions)
npm run playwright-headed

# Run tests in debug mode (step through tests)
npm run playwright-debug

# Show HTML test report
npm run playwright-report
```

#### Using Playwright CLI Directly

For more advanced usage and customized options:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run playwright-headless

# Run specific test file
npm run playwright-headless -- playwright/e2e/clusters/register-cluster.spec.ts

# Run tests for specific directory
npm run playwright-headless -- playwright/e2e/downloads/

# Run with specific browser
BROWSER=chromium npm run playwright-headless

# Run with specific reporter
npm run playwright-headless -- --reporter=html

# Run with parallel executions in multiple workers
npm run playwright-headless -- --workers=<count>

# Run the tests with specific tags
npm run playwright-headless -- --grep="<tag>"

# Generate test code (record browser interactions)
npm exec -- playwright codegen
```

### Authentication

The tests use a global setup that:

1. Loads environment variables from `playwright.env.json`
2. Performs authentication once before all tests run
3. Saves authentication state to `playwright/fixtures/storageState.json`
4. Reuses this state across all test runs
5. Sets necessary cookies to disable consent dialogs

#### Authentication Flow

1. **Global Setup** (`playwright/support/global-setup.ts`):

   - Creates a browser context with proper viewport settings
   - Sets GDPR consent cookies to bypass consent dialogs
   - Handles different authentication methods based on environment

2. **Login Process** (`playwright/page-objects/login-page.ts`):
   - **Standard Flow**: Username → Next → Password → Submit
   - **FedRAMP Flow**: Direct username/password entry for GOV_CLOUD environments

#### Session Management

- Authentication state is persisted in `storageState.json`
- Tests automatically reuse saved authentication without re-login
- Global timeout: 5 minutes per test
- Navigation timeout: 60 seconds
- Action timeout: 15 seconds

This approach is faster and more reliable than logging in for each test.

### Page Object Fixture Pattern

This project uses **Playwright fixtures** for dependency injection of page objects, providing automatic setup/teardown and proper resource management.

#### Fixture Scope: Worker-Scoped

All page object fixtures are **worker-scoped**, meaning:

- Created **once per worker** (suite-level)
- **Shared across all tests** within that worker
- Perfect for **serial test flows** where tests build on each other
- Efficient - **no re-instantiation overhead**
- Automatic cleanup when worker ends

#### Basic Usage

Import the custom `test` and `expect` from fixtures:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../../fixtures/pages';

test.describe.serial('Register cluster flow', () => {
  test.beforeAll(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('cluster-list');
  });

  test('navigate to register cluster', async ({ clusterListPage }) => {
    // Page object automatically injected, no manual setup!
    await clusterListPage.registerCluster().click();
  });

  test('fill cluster details', async ({ registerClusterPage }) => {
    // Same page instance, state maintained from previous test
    await registerClusterPage.clusterIDInput().fill('my-cluster');
  });
});
```

#### Benefits

✅ **No Manual Initialization** - Page objects injected automatically  
✅ **Worker-Scoped Reuse** - Created once, shared across suite tests  
✅ **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript support with IntelliSense  
✅ **Automatic Cleanup** - Resources properly disposed  
✅ **State Persistence** - Perfect for serial user flows

#### Available Page Object Fixtures

- `clusterListPage` - Cluster list operations
- `registerClusterPage` - Register cluster form
- `clusterDetailsPage` - Cluster details and actions
- `ocmRolesAndAccessPage` - OCM roles management
- `tokensPage` - Token management
- `downloadsPage` - Downloads and CLI tools
- `globalNavPage` - Global navigation menu

### Configuration Files

- `playwright.config.ts` - Main Playwright configuration
- `playwright.env.json` - Environment-specific variables (This is not part of repo)

### Troubleshooting

#### Authentication Issues

1. **Invalid Credentials**: Verify environment variables in `playwright.env.json`

#### Environment Issues

1. **Wrong Base URL**: Check `baseURL` in `playwright.config.ts` matches target environment
2. **Network Connectivity**: Verify access to target environment (staging/production)
3. **GOV_CLOUD Settings**: Ensure `GOV_CLOUD=true` for FedRAMP environments

#### Test Execution Issues

1. **Timeout Errors**: Tests include extended timeouts (5 minutes per test, 60s navigation)
2. **Loading Issues**: Tests wait for skeleton loaders and spinners to disappear
3. **Browser Issues**: Try different browsers using `BROWSER` environment variable

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Problems

- **Solution**: Delete `playwright/fixtures/storageState.json` to force re-authentication (only required for local runs)
- **Root Cause**: Expired or corrupted authentication state

#### Environment Variable Issues

- **Solution**: Verify all required variables are set in `playwright.env.json`
- **Check**: Run `npm run playwright-headless -- --list` to verify configuration loading
