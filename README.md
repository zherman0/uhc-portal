# OCM UI

This repository contains the UI components for the OpenShift Cluster
Manager site.

The UI is a JavaScript/TypeScript application written in React and Redux.

Slack channels: `#forum-cluster-management` for OCM in general, `#ocm-osd-ui` for UI.

## Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) `>=18.12.0 <19.0.0 || >=20.0.0 <21.0.0 || >=22.0.0`
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) `1.22.19` - (higher versions are not supported)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) `>= v5.5.2`

## Setup

For a first time setup, it's required to run `yarn fec patch-etc-hosts`.

This may ask for your `sudo` password to add some entries to `/etc/hosts`.

If you're on macOS, then you will need to initialize a new podman virtual machine with `podman machine init`.

> If your macOS is running on an M (ARM) processor, then it's recommended to initialize with this image `--image docker://quay.io/podman/machine-os:5.5`. Higher image versions may not be supported.

If you intend to contribute code, also refer to the [Setup section of the Contributing guide](docs/contributing.md#setup).

## Building

To build the application run these commands:

```
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Running locally

> **Prerequisite:** Podman must be running. On macOS, verify the virtual machine is started with `podman machine start`.

There are two development scripts available:

### `yarn dev` (Hot Module Reloading)

> **Note:** This script requires Red Hat VPN connection to access the UI.

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

### `yarn start`

```bash
yarn install && yarn start
```

The UI will be available at https://prod.foo.redhat.com:1337/openshift/

> For more details on how the dev environment works (FEC, Chrome container, custom ports), see the [FEC Development Environment section](docs/contributing.md#fec-development-environment) in the contributing guide.

By default, UI will use a real staging backend.
You can switch between real backends and mockserver (see below) at any time by
appending `?env=staging` / `?env=production` / `?env=mockdata` URL param.
(`src/config/` directory contains some more options, but they might not work.)

You can find more information about mocked data in the [mocked APIs guide](mockdata/README.md).

In development mode, analytics events are configured to be routed
to the [_OCM Web Portal_ development source on Segment](https://app.segment.com/redhat-devtools/sources/ocm_web_portal_dev/overview).
If you see them in the [production source](https://app.segment.com/redhat-devtools/sources/ocm_web_portal/overview) instead, reload the page once
(this will stick until local storage is cleared).

By default, the UI runs Assisted Installer without standalone mode. To run with Assisted Installer in standalone mode you need to follow these steps:

- Download https://github.com/openshift-assisted/assisted-installer-app project
- Inside assisted-installer-app run `npm install && npm run start:federated`
- In uhc-portal run `LOCAL_APPS=assisted-installer-app:8003 yarn start`

## Continuous integration

See [Continuous integration doc](docs/continuous-integration.md).

## Environments and Deployments

| uhc-portal branch          | deployed env                             | insights-chrome | default backend |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `main`                     | https://console.dev.redhat.com/openshift | stable version  | staging         |
| `main` (specific revision) | https://console.redhat.com/openshift     | stable version  | production      |

## Issues/Troubleshooting

If you get a timeout/network connection issue when running `yarn install`, try increasing the timeout e.g.
`yarn install --network-timeout 600000`.
